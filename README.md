A list of useful browser extensions for different professionals

__Website__: [https://github.com/vamshisuram/awesome-browser-extensions](https://github.com/vamshisuram/awesome-browser-extensions)

## Use case ?
Web has changed quite a lot. From running mere static sites to complex applications.
A lot of people (web-developers per se), have their dot files (configurations) they can import and work on any system.

Imagine an environment, where you can work with your customized settings. Just with a single sign in.
Sign into chrome/mozilla or your favourite browser and let the browser download and install all the extensions, and start working.
Much like a __Dockerfile__ of setting a VM up, but for a browser.
With the evolution of IDEs in browser environment, I guess we will see a future, full of browser extensions.

The goal of the project is to curate useful browser extensions (sometimes we don't know what we need!!) that help us professionally.
